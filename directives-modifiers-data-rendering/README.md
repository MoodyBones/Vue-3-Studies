# Directives

v-if
v-else
v-else-is
v-show
v-for
v-text
v-HTML
v-slot
v-on
v-bind
v-model
v-pre
v-cloak
v-once

## v-model

- Creates a relationship between the data in the instance/component AND a form input
- So that you can dynamically update values
- two way binding

## v-if / v-show

- is a conditional that will display information depending on meeting a requirement.
- This can be anything - buttons, forms, divs, components

### v-if

- if you check in the dev tools you will see
  `<!--v-if-->`
- then when it evaluates to true it will mount the element/button/component
- if that is toggled often, it can be expensive
- and then it's better to use `v-show`

### v-show

- if you check in the dev tools you will see:
- the element/button/component has been mounted, WITH style: none
- alternatively if you have a big component, and you don't want it loaded and chilling in the DOM all the time,
- then it's better to use `v-if`

### v-if / v-if-else

- Conditionally render siblings

### v-bind or :

- For class and style bindings, creating dynamic props and more.
- It's a very popular directive so it comes with a shortcut!

### v-for

- loops through a set of values
- can also do a static number

```html
// you can grab more than one property // and write dynamic keys
<p v-for="(value, key, index) in jokes" :key="`key-${index}-${value}`">
  {{ index }}. {{ key }}: {{ value }}
</p>

data() { return { jokes: { question: 'What do you call a boomerand that won't
come back?', answer: 'A stick', response: 'ROFL', } } }
```

```js
// Static Number
<ul class="">
  <li v-for="num in 5" :key="num">{{ num }}</li>
</ul>


```

### v-once & v-pre

- v-once will not update once it's been rendered
- v-pre will print out the inner text exactly how it is, including code (good for documentation)

`{{$data}}`

- this will print whatever is in data
- great if you want to quickly check something fast, without opening dev tools
- like a respnse from a server

### v-on or @

- extremely useful, so there is a shortcut for
- great for binding events like click and mouseenter
- you can pass in a parameter for the event (param)
- you can also use ternaries directly
- you can haev multiple bindings

Example of multiple bindings

```html
<div
  v-on="
  mousedown: doThis,
  mouseup: doThat
"
></div>
```

- this is great if you want to build games in Vue
- because you can have a click and key event at the same time

### v-html

- great for strings that have html elements that need to be rendered

warning

- do not accept user input and then put it to the page with `v-html`
- incase you don't know what you're getting. you could get hacked.

### v-text

- similar to using the mustache template
- use case for when you don't access to the mustache template and want to add to insert something inside a tag
- If you want to dynamically update things then it is recommend that you use the mustache template because it is updated a little faster.

## id

- it needs to be unique to the DOM
- best practice is to use a library that will generate unique IDs
- uuid

## modifiers

### v-model.trim

- Will string any leading or trailing whitespace from the bound string

### v-model.number

- changes strings to numbers

### v-model.lazy

- won't populate the content automatically, it will wait to bind until an even happens. It listens to change events instead of input
- it is used a lot to aid in performance
- and is used for input validation

### @mousemove.stop

- is comparable to e.stopPropagation()

### @mousemove.prevent

- is comparable to e.preventDefault()

### @submit.prevent

- will no longer reload the page on submission

### @click.once

- do not confuse it with v-once
- this click event will be triggered once

### @click.native

- for listening to native evnts in the DOM

## Keycodes

- Vue 3 uses names instead of numbers for the Keycodes
- this is because the HTML spec has changed and is deprecating the use of numbered keycodes
